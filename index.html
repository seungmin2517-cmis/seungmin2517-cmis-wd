				Lists and Links 
			</h2>
			<p>
				In this assignment, I learned how to insert ordered and unordered lists of items in html file. I also learned how to insert hyperlinks to other websites in my site.
			</p>
			<p>
			<ul>
				<li>Create a file called "listsandlinks.html" in your repository folder.</li>
				<li>In "listsandlinks.html" create an detailed ordered list of step by step instructions to create a new webpage view it on the production server.</li>
				<li>Also create an unordered list of 5 or more links to websites with useful webdesign related information.
In the nav section, create an unordered list of links with a link back to your main index.html page.</li>
				<li>In the nav element of your main index.html file in public_html, add an unordered list of links with a link to "listsandlinks".</li>
				<li>In your old index.html, add a heading and a paragraph description of this assignment. Also add an unordered list that contains this list of requirements.</li> 
				<li>Add declarations to your main.css file to style the lists and links that you created.</li>
				<li>Style the box model properties for all elements.</li>
				<dd>-border</dd>
				<dd>-margin</dd>
				<dd>-padding</dd>
				<dd>-width</dd>
				<dd>-height</dd>
				<li>Use these 2 new selector types.</li>
				<dd>-comma separated - (h1, h2) applies same properties to h1 AND h2</dd>
				<dd>-no-comma separated - (main p) applies to all p elements inside the main element</dd>
				<li>Turn in your work.</li>
